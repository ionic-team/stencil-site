# Mocking

WebdriverIO has support for file based module mocking as well as mocking of entire dependencies of your project. The framework provides a set of primitives for mocking as documented in the project [documentation](https://webdriver.io/docs/component-testing/mocking):

```ts
import { mock, fn, unmock } from '@wdio/browser-runner'
```

To create a mock you can either create a file with the name of the module you like to mock the `__mocks__` directory, as described in [Manual Mocks](https://webdriver.io/docs/component-testing/mocking#manual-mocks), or mock the file directly as part of your test:

```ts
import { mock, fn } from '@wdio/browser-runner'
import { format } from './utils/utils.ts'

// mock files within the project
mock('./utils/utils.ts', () => {
    format: fn().mockReturnValue(42)
})
// mock whole modules and replace functionality with what is defined in `./__mocks__/leftpad.ts`
mock('leftpad')

console.log(format()) // returns `42`
```

Once a module is mocked, importing it either from your test or your component will give you the mocked version of the module and not the actual one.
