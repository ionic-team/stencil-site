# Upgrading to Stencil v4.0.0

:::caution 
Stencil 4.0.0 is pre-release software.
These instructions are for users looking to try an early version of the software
:::

## Getting Started

We recommend that you only upgrade to Stencil v4 from Stencil v3.
If you're a few versions behind, we recommend upgrading one major version at a time (from v1 to v2, then v2 to v3, finally v3 to v4).
This will minimize the number of breaking changes you have to deal with at the same time.

For breaking changes introduced in previous major versions of the library, see:
- [Stencil v3 Breaking Changes](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/blob/main/BREAKING_CHANGES.md#stencil-v300)
- [Stencil v2 Breaking Changes](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/blob/main/BREAKING_CHANGES.md#stencil-two)
- [Stencil v1 Breaking Changes](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/blob/main/BREAKING_CHANGES.md#stencil-one)

For projects that are on Stencil v3, install the latest version of Stencil v4: `npm install @stencil/core@v4-next`
