And Ionic’s challenge has always been to easily distribute a large library of UI components, for both Material Design and iOS, while still staying performant and having a fast startup for Progressive Web Apps. In helping to solve the problem, Ionic moved to using Web Components, which can be distributed and consumed in numerous ways, each with their own pros and cons. But just using Web Components alone does not solve the startup and file size problem."],"\n",["p",null,"We’re often asked “how” Stencil’s lazy loading works, and how one script can serve as a single entry point to a large library.

In this article I’d like to describe a little further the reasoning behind each decision."],"\n",["p",null,["em",null,"Disclaimer: This is by no means claiming to be the one-true way to lazy load components.

However, lazy loading components often enters a great deal of complexity of bundling, package.json and router configurations, custom framework logic built within each component and wrappers, and we’ve quickly lost the abilities of easily using a script tag. Alternatively, other lazy-load solutions require hardcoded HTML attribute values to go alongside even more custom runtime logic in order for the modules to be requested and wired up correctly."],"\n",["p",null,"With Stencil, one of its output targets is to define all of the components within the DOM, but the key is it does not require any of the component logic, and the predefined components are simply proxy components with no logic.

The compiler actually has a handful of output targets, but for now we’re focusing on the lazy-loading default."],"\n",["p",null,"With the lazy loading output target, once one of the components is added to DOM, the proxy component then requests and asynchronously wires up the component’s core logic to the host element on-demand.
