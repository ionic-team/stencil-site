It is not only able to better optimize your components, but is designed to be completely future-proof.</p>

  <h2>What is Stencil?</h2>
  <p>If you’re not familiar with <a href="https://next.stenciljs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stencil</a>, it is an open source (MIT) toolchain that builds reusable, scalable Design Systems by combining the best features from popular frontend frameworks and generating standard Web Components (instead of a third-party component model).</p>
  <p>Stencil was first announced in 2017 at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfD-k7aHkQE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polymer Summit</a> by my colleagues, <a href="https://github.com/adamdbradley" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Bradley</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mlynch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Max Lynch</a>. Originally called “Ionic core” internally, Stencil was born out of our desire to solve our own JS Framework dependency problems and increase performance for Ionic Framework. As it turns out, Stencil ended up solving a lot more than that.</p>
  <p>Building Stencil allowed us to <a href="https://blog.ionicframework.com/introducing-ionic-4-ionic-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">release Ionic 4</a> for Angular, React, Vue, or for no framework at all, powering roughly 100 cross-platform UI components in two separate styles (iOS and Material Design). As a result, the Ionic Framework team is now able to focus 100% of its time on shipping the best collection of UI components, gestures, animations, etc. without having to worry about browser-support, framework integrations, or performance—as Stencil automatically applies these built-in best practices.</p>
  <p>Over the last two years, we’ve been surprised and incredibly humbled by the groundswell of community adoption Stencil has garnered. The project has over 200 contributors around the world, with thousands of developers, teams, and large organizations building on it. Frankly, we couldn’t be more grateful!</p>
  <p>With that said, let’s dive into some of the exciting features shipping with Stencil One.</p>
  <h2>Machine Learning-inspired Bundling</h2>
  <p>Stencil One uses a new bundling algorithm inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding">“word embedding”</a>, a popular Machine Learning technique. It allows us to pack components more efficiently, therefore reducing the network throughput and round-trips. In order to do this, we generate a <em>N-dimensional</em> vector space where each component represents a coordinate. These coordinates are generated based on the previous static analysis of how components depend on each other. Later, the components that are located close enough in the vectorial space are bundled together. A blog post explaining this technique will be coming soon!</p>

  <p>While we bundle components to reduce the number of scripts, Stencil relies on ES modules that execute natively in the browser. Today, all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge) implement ES2017 and ES modules, which means we don’t ship any runtime to load modules.</p>
  <p>At the same time, we still support old browsers such as IE11, thanks to “<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/modules#browser" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">differential bundling</a>”, which automatically generates the smallest possible bundle for each browser based on their capabilities.</p>
  <p><img src="https://blog.ionicframework.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-14-at-18.07.17-1024x527.png" alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2813" srcset="https://blog.ionicframework.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-14-at-18.07.17-1024x527.png 1024w, https://blog.ionicframework.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-14-at-18.07.17-300x154.png 300w, https://blog.ionicframework.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-14-at-18.07.17-768x395.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"/></p>
  <p>In addition, all the metadata collected by the compiler and the dependency graph generated by rollup can be used to automatically create <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/12/modulepreload" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“modulepreload” links</a>, reducing the amount of network round-trips required to download all the JS in the critical path to zero. This drastically reduces the Time-To-Interactive of apps built with Stencil.</p>
  <p><img src="https://blog.ionicframework.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-14-at-18.15.41-1024x746.png" alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2815" srcset="https://blog.ionicframework.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-14-at-18.15.41-1024x746.png 1024w, https://blog.ionicframework.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-14-at-18.15.41-300x219.png 300w, https://blog.ionicframework.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-14-at-18.15.41-768x559.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"/></p>
  <h2>Advanced Runtime Removal</h2>
  <p>With the new compiler, Stencil now shrinks the size and number of bundles sent to users. The metadata collected during the static analysis phase is used together with tree-shaking to <em>completely</em> remove the parts of the runtime that are not used.</p>
  <p>While the <code>hello-world</code> demo is clearly an artificial example, we are excited about being able to generate incredibly small dependency-free components that include only what they need. Our <strong>133bytes Hello World app</strong> (including runtime) is an example of the power of the compiler.</p>
  <p>This optimization also scales as the complexity of the components increases. Here’s an example with the <a href="https://todomvc-stencil-one.firebaseapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TodoMVC app</a>:</p>
  <p><img src="https://blog.ionicframework.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/stencil-bundle-comparison-1024x569.png" alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2820" srcset="https://blog.ionicframework.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/stencil-bundle-comparison-1024x569.png 1024w, https://blog.ionicframework.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/stencil-bundle-comparison-300x167.png 300w, https://blog.ionicframework.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/stencil-bundle-comparison-768x427.png 768w, https://blog.ionicframework.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/stencil-bundle-comparison.png 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"/></p>
  <h2>JIT-friendly Runtime</h2>
  <p>We have also profiled and refactored the runtime to be smaller and much faster at execution-time. The new runtime avoids patterns that lead to non-optimal bytecode (usually called optimization killers), improves our async scheduler, and adopts new APIs like <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/constructable-stylesheets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constructable Stylesheets</a>, native ES modules, and <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/fast-async" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">native async-await</a>.</p>
  <p>In this benchmark, we add 8,000 <code>ion-button</code> components (yes, eight-THOUSAND) to an app. At first glance, <code>ion-button</code> might appear simple, but it hides a great deal of complexity. It’s comprised of many classes and nested elements which give it the professional and polished visual appearance on both iOS and Android. Put another way, this stress test is attaching more than <em>200,000</em> nodes to the DOM.</p>
  <p>Historically, it took ~6 seconds to fully initialize the app with well over 269,000 nodes:</p>
  <p><img src="https://blog.ionicframework.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-14-at-19.13.23-1024x661.png" alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2810" srcset="https://blog.ionicframework.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-14-at-19.13.23-1024x661.png 1024w, https://blog.ionicframework.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-14-at-19.13.23-300x194.png 300w, https://blog.ionicframework.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-14-at-19.13.23-768x496.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"/></p>
  <p>With Stencil One, the exact same test finishes in 3 seconds. That’s <strong>2x times faster</strong>! In addition, the memory usage is reduced from <strong>180MB to 80MB</strong>.</p>
  <p><img src="https://blog.ionicframework.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-14-at-19.09.08-1024x661.png" alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2811" srcset="https://blog.ionicframework.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-14-at-19.09.08-1024x661.png 1024w, https://blog.ionicframework.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-14-at-19.09.08-300x194.png 300w, https://blog.ionicframework.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-14-at-19.09.08-768x496.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"/></p>
  <p>Best of all, Ionic developers don’t have to go through any painful rewrites. Instead, they will automatically unlock these performance improvements on their existing projects just from the compiler upgrade.</p>
