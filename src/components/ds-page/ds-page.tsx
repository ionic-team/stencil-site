          <h4>FAQ for Stencil DS</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Is Stencil free?</b>
              <p>
                Yes, the official Stencil project is 100% free and open source (MIT licensed), and
                always will be. We offer Stencil DS for teams undertaking large Design System initiatives which offers
                additional features and tools that
                are not free. This keeps the lights on and lets us keep making the Stencil you know and love better and better, all while
                helping teams be successful with their Design System initiatives.

            <li id="libraries">
              <b>What are Angular, React, and Vue libraries for Stencil?</b>
              <p>
                Stencil builds standard Web Components that run in all modern browsers, with intelligent loading of any
                necessary polyfills for clients with missing APIs.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, developers often prefer a framework's conventions for naming and usage that deviates from typical Web Component usage.
                In addition, building a library that can be consumed natively in each framework is tricky and is a moving target.
              </p>
              <p>
                To help with this, Stencil DS automatically generates up-to-date libraries for all major frameworks and smooths
                out any rough edges in their Web Component support. This also makes using Stencil-built components feel
                native to each framework and work like other component libraries for that framework.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li id="cms">
              <b>How do Content Management System (CMS) Integrations work?</b>
              <p>
                Teams building Design Systems are looking to bring consistent, well-supported components
                to all corners of their app and web properties. For most teams, that means enabling
                web and marketing teams to drop in components from your Design System directly in their CMS
                workflow is key.
              </p>
              <p>
                Stencil integrates with many popular CMS solutions to bring your Design System directly to content
                creators in a way that works naturally with their existing tools, all while preserving the performance
                and accessibility benefits of a Stencil-built component system.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li id="documentation">
              <b>What is Automated Documentation Generation?</b>
              <p>
                One of the greatest challenges for Design Systems is adoption. Developers will take the
                path of least resistance to get their work done, and that means the best documentation wins.
              </p>
              <p>
                To ensure your Design System achieves mass adoption, Stencil DS generates top-quality
                documentation automatically from your components, with rich metadata about properties and
                events gathered directly from your component code.
              </p>
              <p>
                Stencil DS generates live examples, code snippets, and an index
                of all your components in a beautiful but easily customizable fashion, to make it
                incredibly fast and easy for developers to find and use the components they need.
              </p>
              <p>
                The team behind Stencil DS's documentation generation built <a href="http://ionicframework.com/docs">Ionic Framework's
                documentation</a>, regarded by many as some of the best developer documentation for an open source project. We
                can bring that level of developer regard directly to your Design System's official documentation.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li id="accessibility">
              <b>How do you verify components meet Accessibility standards?</b>
              <p>
                Building a Design System with Web Component APIs that exceeds accessibility standards
                is not straightforward. Stencil DS comes with a number of features and tools that help
                verify and <i>enforce</i> accessibility support for your components in a continuous way that can
                be easily integrated into your Continuous Integration workflow.
              </p>
              <p>
                This goes above and beyond
                existing Accessibility testing tools and ensures your Design System initiative meets and exceeds
                all legal requirements for Accessibility.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li id="testing">
              <b>How do I ensure components don't have visual UI regressions or issues in specific browsers?</b>
              <p>
                One of the biggest challenges to building any sophisticated component kit or Design System is
                ensuring components don't have visual regressions due to changes in styles or issues with
                specific browsers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unfortunately, traditional unit testing or snapshot testing is not sufficient to test visual style and layout changes.
                The Ionic team built out a set of powerful visual regression testing tools to ensure consistency between releases.
              </p>
              <p>
                Stencil DS brings these powerful visual regression tools to teams building Design Systems,
                and helps them integrate with your existing
                Continuous Integration workflow to provide UI verification on every single commit.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li id="support">
              <b>What do I get with Premium Support?</b>
              <p>
                While Stencil has an active community and is being actively maintained, there are cases
                where certain bugs or features are not a priority due to misalignment with our open source
                roadmap or time constraints.
              </p>
              <p>
                For teams deploying major Design System initiatives, relying on open source and community support is
                not sufficient. You'll need
                assurance that key issues or features are identified and communicated quickly, with potential fixes or workarounds
                made available in a timely fashion.
              </p>
              <p>
                With Stencil DS, Premium Support is provided and teams will have a dedicated account manager to
                communicate with if anything goes wrong.
