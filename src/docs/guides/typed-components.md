# Typed Components

Web Components generated with stencil come with typing information automatically generated by the Stencil compiler. Typescript declarations provide strong guarantees when consuming components:

- Ensuring that proper values are passed down as properties
- Code autocompletion in modern IDEs such as Atom and VSCode
- Events' details
- Signature of components' methods

This public types are automatically generated by Stencil in `src/component.d.ts`, which allows for strong typing in JSX (just like React) and `HTMLElement` interfaces for each component.

Because Web Components generated by Stencil are just vanilla Web Components, they extend the `HTMLElement` interface. For each component a type named `HTML{CamelCaseTag}Element` is registered at the global scope, meaning developers DO NOT have to import them explicitly, just like `HTMLElement` or `HTMLScriptElement` are not imported.

- `ion-button` => `HTMLIonButtonElement`
- `ion-menu-controller` => `HTMLIonMenuControllerElement`

```tsx
const button: HTMLIonButtonElement = document.queryElement('ion-button');
button.fill = 'outline';
```

**IMPORTANT**: always use the `HTML{}Element` interfaces in order to hold references to components.
