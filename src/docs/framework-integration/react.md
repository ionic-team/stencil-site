# React

With an application built using the `create-react-app` script the easiest way to include the component library is to call `defineCustomElements(window)` from the `index.js` file.
Note that in this scenario `applyPolyfills` is needed if you are targeting Edge or IE11.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import registerServiceWorker from './registerServiceWorker';

// test-component is the name of our made up Web Component that we have
// published to npm:
import { defineCustomElements } from 'test-components/loader';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
registerServiceWorker();

applyPolyfills().then(() => {
  defineCustomElements(window);
});
```

Following the steps above will enable your web components to be used in React, however there are some additional complexities that must also be considered.  https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/ describes them well.
