# Testing Config

The `testing` config setting specifies an object that corresponds to the jest configuration that should be used in your tests. Stencil provides a default configuration, which you likely won't need to edit, however it can be extended with the same configuration options as Jest. See the [Configuring Jest Guide](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration.html) for configuration details.

> Keep in mind that the usual way of configuring Jest (`package.json` and `jest.config.js`) is not used with the `stencil testing` command. Jest can still be used, but configuring the presets, transpilation and setting up the correct commands must be done by the project.

Some additional Stencil specific options may be set here as well for configuring the e2e tests:

```tsx
export interface TestingConfig extends JestConfig {
  /**
   * The `allowableMismatchedPixels` value is used to determine an acceptable
   * number of pixels that can be mismatched before the image is considered
   * to have changes. Realistically, two screenshots representing the same
   * content may have a small number of pixels that are not identical due to
   * anti-aliasing, which is perfectly normal. If the `allowableMismatchedRatio`
   * is provided it will take precedence, otherwise `allowableMismatchedPixels`
   * will be used.
   */
  allowableMismatchedPixels?: number;

  /**
   * The `allowableMismatchedRatio` ranges from `0` to `1` and is used to
   * determine an acceptable ratio of pixels that can be mismatched before
   * the image is considered to have changes. Realistically, two screenshots
   * representing the same content may have a small number of pixels that
   * are not identical due to anti-aliasing, which is perfectly normal. The
   * `allowableMismatchedRatio` is the number of pixels that were mismatched,
   * divided by the total number of pixels in the screenshot. For example,
   * a ratio value of `0.06` means 6% of the pixels can be mismatched before
   * the image is considered to have changes. If the `allowableMismatchedRatio`
   * is provided it will take precedence, otherwise `allowableMismatchedPixels`
   * will be used.
   */
  allowableMismatchedRatio?: number;

  /**
   * Matching threshold while comparing two screenshots. Value ranges from `0` to `1`.
   * Smaller values make the comparison more sensitive. The `pixelmatchThreshold`
   * value helps to ignore anti-aliasing. Default: `0.1`
   */
  pixelmatchThreshold?: number;

  /**
   * Additional arguments to pass to the browser instance.
   */
  browserArgs?: string[];

   * Useful so that you can see what is going on.
   */

  /**

   * test is ran for each emulation.
   */
