# Custom Elements Bundle

The `dist-custom-elements-bundle` type is used to generate a custom elements as a single bundle. Don't worry about the output being a "single" bundle, because it's generated to ensure components are tree-shakable. For example, if a component library has 100 components, but an external project only imported one component from the bundle, then only the code used by that one component would be pulled into the project. This is due to Stencil's use of ES Modules and the compiler generating friendly code for bundlers to parse and understand.

### How is this different than "dist" output target?

The `dist-custom-elements-bundle` builds each component as a stand-alone class that extends `HTMLElement`. The output is a standardized custom element with the styles already attached and without any of Stencil's lazy-loading. This may be preferred for projects that are already handling bundling, lazy-loading and defining the custom elements themselves.

The `dist` output target on the other hand is more for projects that want to be able allow each component to lazy-load themselves, without having to setup bundling configurations to do so.

Luckily, both builds can be generated at the same time, and shipped in the same distribution. It would be up to the consumer of your component library to decide which build to use.


```tsx
outputTargets: [
  {
    type: 'dist-custom-elements-bundle'
  }
]
```

## Custom Elements Bundle

Your component library can be easily distributed on Npm, similar to how [`@ionic/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ionic/core) does it. From there consumers of your library can decide how to import your library into their project.


## Importing and Defining Custom Elements

The generated bundle will export each component class and will already have the styles bundled . However, it does not define the custom elements, or apply any polyfills.


## Legacy Browsers

If the library is to be used on IE11 we recommand using the [`dist` output target](/output-targets/dist) instead since it will only load the required polyfills on-demand. The `dist-custom-elements-bundle` we only recommend if for modern browsers that already support Custom Elements, Shadow DOM and CSS Variables (basically not IE11 or Edge 18 and below). Good news is that they're all widely supported for modern web develoment:

- [Shadow DOM Support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=shadowdomv1)
- [CSS Variables Support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables)
