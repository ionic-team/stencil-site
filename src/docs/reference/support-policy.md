# Support Policy

## Community Maintenance

Stencil is a 100% open source (MIT) project. Developers can ensure Stencil is the right choice for building web
components through Ionicâ€™s community maintenance strategy. The Stencil team regularly ships new releases, bug fixes, and
is welcoming to community pull requests.

## Stencil Maintenance and Support Status

Given the reality of time and resource restraints as well as the desire to keep innovating in the frontend development
space, over time it becomes necessary for the Stencil team to shift focus to newer versions of the library. However, the
Stencil team will do everything it can to make the transition to newer versions as smooth as possible. The Stencil team
recommends updating to the newest version of the Stencil for the latest features, improvements and stability updates.

The current status of each Stencil version is:

| Version |     Status     |   Released   | Maintenance Ends | Ext. Support Ends |
|:-------:|:--------------:|:------------:|:----------------:|:-----------------:|
|   V2    |   **Active**   | Aug 08, 2020 |       TBD        |        TBD        |
|   V1    | End of Support | Jun 03, 2019 |   Aug 08, 2020   |   Aug 08, 2020    |

**Maintenance Period**: Only critical bug and security fixes. No major feature improvements.

**Extended Support Period**: For teams and organizations that require additional long term support, Ionic has extended 
support options available. To learn more, see our
[Enterprise offerings](https://ionicframework.com/sales?product_of_interest=Design%20Systems).

### Stencil Support Details

Starting with Stencil v2, the Stencil team is adopting a newly revised maintenance policy. When a new major version of
Stencil is released, the previous major version release will enter maintenance mode. While a version of Stencil is in
maintenance mode, only critical bug & security fixes will be applied to that version, and no major feature improvements
will be added. The maintenance period shall last three months from the release of the new major version.

Once the maintenance period has ended for a version of Stencil, that version enters the extended support period. During
the extended support period, only critical bug and security fixes will be applied for teams and organizations using
Stencil's Enterprise offerings. The extended  support period lasts for six months from the release of the new major 
version.

The table below describes a theoretical timeline of releases:

| Version |        Status         |   Released   | Maintenance Ends | Ext. Support Ends |
|:-------:|:---------------------:|:------------:|:----------------:|:-----------------:|
|    D    |        Active         | Jan 01, 2022 |       TBD        |        TBD        |
|    C    |      Maintenance      | Jul 07, 2021 |   Apr 01, 2022   |   Jul 01, 2022    |
|    B    | Extended Support Only | Jan 01, 2021 |   Oct 07, 2021   |   Jan 07, 2022    |
|    A    |    End of Support     | Jul 07, 2020 |   Apr 01, 2021   |   Jul 01, 2021    |

In the example above, when Version D is released, Version C enters maintenance mode. Version D was released on January
1st, 2022. Version C shall be in maintenance mode until April 1st, 2022, three months after the release of Version D.
After April 1st 2022, Version C will be in extended support until July 1st, 2022, six months after the release of
Version D.

## Compatibility Recommendations

Stencil is in many regards an opinionated library, and includes much of the software necessary to get users building web
components as quickly as possible. There are a few pieces of software that Stencil allows users to choose to best fit
their team, organizational structure, and existing technical stack. The Stencil team has compiled a series of
compatibility tables to describe the interoperability requirements of these pieces of software and Stencil.

### JavaScript Runtime

| Stencil Version | Node v10 | Node v12 | Node v14 | Node v16 | Node v18 |  Deno*  |
|:---------------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:-------:|
|       V2        | &#10060; | &#9989;  | &#9989;  | &#9989;  | &#10060; | &#9888; |
|       V1        | &#9989;  | &#9989;  | &#9989;  | &#9989;  | &#10060; | &#9888; |

\* Experimental Deno support was available in Stencil
[v1.16.0](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/releases/tag/v1.16.0) through
[v2.8.1](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/releases/tag/v2.8.1). This experimental support was removed in 
[v2.9.0](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/releases/tag/v2.9.0). For additional reasoning behind this decision, 
please see [this document](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/blob/main/docs/adr/0013-deno-removal.md).
