# Support Policy

## Community Maintenance

The Stencil is a 100% open source (MIT) project. Developers can ensure Stencil is the right choice for building web 
components through Ionic’s community maintenance strategy. The Stencil team regularly ships new releases, bug fixes, and 
is welcoming to community pull requests.

### Where can I get support?

If this is your first time building a design system, or you’re new to Stencil, [get in touch](https://ionicframework.com/sales?product_of_interest=Design%20Systems) with one of our Solutions Engineers for a consultation on how to meet your goals and get the most out of the platform.

### What versions of Stencil are currently supported?

Currently, Stencil is on version 2.

Stencil follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), meaning that the team at Ionic strives to avoid any type of breaking change to Stencil without changing the 'major version number' of the library. Therefore, versions 2.7.0 and 2.8.0 are designed to be backwards compatible with one another. However, there may be breaking changes between v2.7.0 and v3.0.0. Breaking changes to the library can be found [here](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/blob/master/BREAKING_CHANGES.md).

To determine the version of Stencil your project has installed, run:
```shell
npm ls @stencil/core
```

To view the latest version of Stencil, please see the project's [releases page](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/releases).

> At this time, versions 0 and 1 of Stencil are not actively supported.
