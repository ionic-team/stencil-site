# Component Lifecycle Methods

Components have numerous lifecycle methods which can be used to know when the component "will" and "did" load, update, and unload. These methods can be added to a component to hook into operations at the right time.

Implement one of the following methods within a component class and Stencil will automatically call them in the right order:

```jsx
import { Component } from '@stencil/core';

@Component({
  tag: 'my-component'
})
export class MyComponent {

  /**
   * The component is about to load and it has not
   * rendered yet.
   *
   * This is the best place to make any data updates
   * before the first render.
   *
   * componentWillLoad will only be called once.
   */
  componentWillLoad() {
    console.log('Component is about to be rendered');
  }

  /**
   * The component has loaded and has already rendered.
   *
   * Updating data in this method will cause the
   * component to re-render.
   *
   * componentDidLoad will only be called once.
   */
  componentDidLoad() {
    console.log('Component has been rendered');
  }

  /**
   * The component is about to update and re-render.
   *
   * Called multiple times throughout the life of
   * the component as it updates.
   *
   * componentWillUpdate is not called on the first render.
   */
  componentWillUpdate() {
    console.log('Component will update and re-render');
  }

  /**
   * The component has just re-rendered.
   *
   * Called multiple times throughout the life of
   * the component as it updates.
   *
   * componentDidUpdate is not called on the
   * first render.
   */
  componentDidUpdate() {
    console.log('Component did update');
  }

  /**
   * The component did unload and the element
   * will be destroyed.
   */
  componentDidUnload() {
    console.log('Component removed from the DOM');
  }
}
```


## Rendering State

It's always recommended to make any rendered state updates within `componentWillLoad()` or `componentWillUpdate()`, since these are the methods which get called _before_ the `render()` method. Alternatively, updating rendered state with the `componentDidLoad()` or `componentDidUpdate()` methods will cause another re-render, which isn't ideal for performance.

If state _must_ be updated in `componentDidUpdate()`, it has the potential of getting components stuck in an infinite loop. If updating state within `componentDidUpdate()` is unavoidable, then the method should also come with a way to detect if the props or state is "dirty" or not (is the data actually different or is it the same as before). By doing a dirty check, `componentDidUpdate()` is able to avoid rendering the same data, and which in turn calls `componentDidUpdate()` again.


## Lifecycle Hierarchy

A useful feature of lifecycle methods is that they take their child component's lifecycle into consideration too. For example, if the parent component, `cmp-a`, has a child component, `cmp-b`, then `cmp-a` isn't considered "loaded" until `cmp-b` has finished loading. Another way to put it is that the deepest components finish loading first, then the `componentDidLoad()` calls bubble up.

It's also important to note that even though Stencil can lazy-load components, and has asynchronous rendering, the lifecycle methods are still called in the correct order. So while the top-level component could have already been loaded, all of its lifecycle methods are still called in the correct order, which means it'll wait for a child components to finish loading. The same goes for the exact opposite, where the child components may already be ready while the parent isn't.

In the example below we have a simple hierarchy of components. The numbered list shows the order of which the lifecycle methods will fire.

```html
  <cmp-a>
    <cmp-b>
      <cmp-c></cmp-c>
    </cmp-b>
  </cmp-a>
```

1. `cmp-a` - `componentWillLoad()`
2. `cmp-b` - `componentWillLoad()`
3. `cmp-c` - `componentWillLoad()`
4. `cmp-c` - `componentDidLoad()`
5. `cmp-b` - `componentDidLoad()`
6. `cmp-a` - `componentDidLoad()`

Even if some components may or may not be already loaded, the entire component hierarchy waits on its child components to finish loading and rendering.


## Async Lifecycle Methods

Lifecycle methods can also return promises which allows the method to asynchronously retrieve data or perform any async tasks. A great example of this is fetching data to be rendered in a component. For example, this very site you're reading first fetches content data before rendering. But because `fetch()` is async, it's important that `componentWillLoad()` returns a `Promise` to ensure its parent component isn't considered "loaded" until all of its content has rendered.

Below is a quick example showing how `componentWillLoad()` is able to have its parent component wait on it to finish loading its data.

```typescript
componentWillLoad() {
  return fetch('/some-data.json')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
      this.content = data;
    });
}
```


## Example

This simple example shows a clock and updates the current time every second. Since `componentDidLoad` is only called once, we will only ever have one instance of the timer running. Once the component unloads, the timer is stopped.

```jsx
import { Component, State } from '@stencil/core';


@Component({
  tag: 'custom-clock'
})
export class CustomClock {

  timer: number;

  @State() time: number = Date.now();

  componentDidLoad() {
    this.timer = window.setInterval(() => {
      this.time = Date.now();
    }, 1000);
  }

  componentDidUnload() {
    window.clearInterval(this.timer);
  }

  render() {
    const time = new Date(this.time).toLocaleTimeString();

    return (
      <span>{ time }</span>
    );
  }
}
```
