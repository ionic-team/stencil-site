# Component Life Cycle

Components receive events during their lifecycle, including loading, updating, and unloading. These hooks can be handled in a component for performing operations at the right time.

Simply implement one of the following methods and Stencil will automatically call it:

```jsx
import { Component } from '@stencil/core';

@Component({
  tag: 'my-component'
})
export class MyComponent {

  /**
   * The component will load but has not rendered yet.
   * 
   * This is a good place to make any last minute updates before rendering.
   * 
   * Will only be called once 
   */
  componentWillLoad() {
    console.log('The component is about to be rendered');
  }

  /**
   * The component is loaded and has rendered.
   * 
   * Updating data in this event may cause the component to re-render.
   * 
   * Will only be called once
   */
  componentDidLoad() {
    console.log('The component has been rendered');
  }

  /**
   * The component will update and re-render.
   *
   * Called multiple times throughout the life of the component as it updates.
   */
  componentWillUpdate() {
    console.log('The component will update');
  }

  /**
   * The component finished updating.
   *
   * Called after componentWillUpdate
   * 
   * Called multiple times throughout the life of the component as it updates.
   */
  componentDidUpdate() {
    console.log('The component did update');
  }

  /**
   * The component did unload and the element will be destroyed.
   */
  componentDidUnload() {
    console.log('The view has been removed from the DOM');
  }
}
```

## Example

This simple example starts a timer as soon as the component loads, and updates the curent time every second. Since `componentDidLoad` is only called once, we will only ever have one instance of the timer running. Once the component unloads, the timer is stopped.

```jsx
import { Component, State } from '@stencil/core';


@Component({
  tag: 'custom-timer'
})
export class CustomTimer {
  
  timer: number;

  @State() time: number = Date.now();

  componentDidLoad() {
    this.timer = window.setInterval(() => {
      this.time = Date.now();
    }, 1000);
  }

  componentDidUnload() {
    clearInterval(this.timer);
  }

  render() {
    let time = new Date(this.time).toLocaleTimeString();

    return (
      <span>{ time }</span>
    );
  }
}
```
