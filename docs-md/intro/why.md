## Why Stencil?

Stencil is a new approach to a popular idea: building fast and feature-rich apps in the browser. Stencil was created to take advantage of major new capabilities available natively in the browser, such as Custom Elements v1, enabling developers to ship far less code and build faster apps that are compatible with any and all frameworks.

Stencil is also a solution to organizations and library authors struggling to build reusable components across a diverse spectrum of frontend frameworks, each with their own component system. Stencil components work in Angular, React, Ember, and Vue as well as they work with jQuery or with no framework at all, because they are just plain HTML elements.

Compared to using Custom Elements directly, inside of every Stencil component is an efficient Virtual DOM rendering system, JSX rendering capabilities, asynchronous rendering pipeline (like React Fiber), and more. This makes Stencil components more performant while maintaining full compatibility with plain Custom Elements. Think of Stencil as creating pre-baked Custom Elements as if you wrote in those features yourself.
